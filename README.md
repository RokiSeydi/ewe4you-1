# ewe4you

ewe4you is a client's project built collaboratively with 9 other colleagues.
By completing different tasks on different pages, the app aims at educating children and young adults on mental wellbeing.

The different components of the website were completed in pairs. 

A colleague and myself worked on the "Living Stress Graph", which is a graph that shows on a pie chart what mental stressors the users find the most difficult to cope with.

The projects was created using:
- React.js
- Firebase Authentication
- Firebase Database
- Figma
